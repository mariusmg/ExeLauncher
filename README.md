ExeLauncher-
============

CLI launcher which aims to "fix" the fact that PATH environment variable entry on Windows is not recursive.

Options (open el.exe.config")

-Paths : enter list of paths where the app will look for files (values must be comma separated).

-Extensions : list of supported file extensions (if you're not interested in bat files just leave exe).

-FolderDepth : the depth to look for subfolders from top folder. Either numerical value or * to look everywhere.
